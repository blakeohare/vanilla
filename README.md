# Vanilla

Vanilla is a programming language that transpiles to other languages. The code that is generated is "vanilla" code 
in the target language. That is to say that it is self-contained and has little-to-no dependencies on frameworks or
libraries. This allows you to, for example, write core business logic in Vanilla and include it in cross-platform
projects.

While this is still in development, the planned output languages include the following:

- **JavaScript** - exports to a monolith vanilla JS file
- **C** - includes simple garbage collection. Relies only on standard libraries.

Eventually, this will replace Pastel and thus will have support for the following other target languages:

- C#
- Java
- Python
- Ruby
- PHP
